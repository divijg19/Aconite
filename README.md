## The Mission

In today's tech landscape, knowing Python isn't enough. **Project Aconite** is a deliberate and intensive journey to bridge the gap between academic knowledge and job-ready, professional-grade Python development- a living project, showcasing a commitment to best practices and continuous learning.

This repository documents a three-month curriculum focused on writing clean, efficient, and production-ready code. The goal is not just to learn libraries, but to internalize the "Pythonic" way of thinking and to master the complete workflow—from data cleaning and model training to API deployment and testing.


## Curriculum

### Python Fundamentals & The "Pythonic" Way

**Objective:** Build a rock-solid foundation by moving beyond the basics to write efficient, idiomatic, and maintainable Python code.

| Weeks | Focus Area                   | Key Skills & Technologies                                  |
| :---- | :--------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1-2** | **Core Python Mastery**        | Advanced OOP, Data Structures (`collections`), Error Handling |
| **3-4** | **Idiomatic & Efficient Python** | List Comprehensions, Generators, Context Managers, Decorators |
| **`Job-Ready Skills`** | **Professional Tooling**     | `venv` (Environment Mgmt), `pytest` (Unit Testing)         |

### Python Scientific Computing Stack

**Objective:** Master the essential libraries for high-performance data manipulation and analysis, with a focus on writing vectorized, bottleneck-free code.

| Weeks | Focus Area            | Key Skills & Technologies                          |

| **`Job-Ready Skills`** | **Performance Tuning** | `cProfile` (Code Profiling & Optimization)         |

### Machine Learning in Practice

**Objective:** Go from theory to practice by building, training, and deploying a machine learning model using a full-stack, production-oriented approach.

| Weeks   | Focus Area               | Key Skills & Technologies                               |

## ✅ Q1 Milestone Project: End-to-End ML Pipeline

This repository culminates in a complete, end-to-end machine learning project that demonstrates proficiency across the entire development lifecycle.

*   **Problem:** Predict a real-world outcome (e.g., customer churn, housing prices) using a public dataset.
*   **Data Processing:** A robust data cleaning and feature engineering pipeline built with **Pandas**.
*   **Modeling:** A neural network model built and trained in **PyTorch**.
*   **Deployment:** The trained model is served via a REST API built with **FastAPI**, capable of delivering real-time predictions.
*   **Testing:** The project includes unit tests for the data pipeline and integration tests for the API endpoints using **pytest**.
*   **Documentation:** A professional `README.md` and clear code comments ensure the project is understandable and maintainable.
